# Use LLM to evaluate contract against contract matrix

## Background

I'm developing an AI-powered contract review application.
Existing tools for LLM: `google_docs_tools/tools.py`.
Contract approval matrix: `contract_approval_matrix.json`
Flow:

1. LLM receives a Google Docs URL from user (the sales contract sent by customer)
2. Use tools to read the content
3. Use reasoning to identify contract terms that violate contractual policies of the supplier, based on contract approval
4. Use reasoning to identify the person to escalate for approval, based on contract approval matrix
5. Use tools to add comment to Google Docs contract
6. Use tools to highlight policy violation terms in Google Docs contract
7. Return a summary to user

## 1st requirement for you now

1. Implement a simple Python script that can be executed by a FastAPI endpoint
2. FastAPI is for frontend chatbot-ui to integrate
3. FastAPI will be implemented soon, not now
4. Right now, just a simple Python script to invoke LLM to read the contract, check againts approval matrix, add comments and highlight texts in Google Docs contract, return a summary to user
5. Summary can look like this for example

    ```TEXT
    {High-level summary generated by AI. Max 2 sentences}

    <h2>Contract terms deviations from policies</h2>
    {State how many terms are violating policies}

    {State the highest level of escalation, the role required to approves/decides}

    {Suggest user to visit Google Docs for more details}
    ```

6. Escalation level: Head of BU < BA President < CEO
7. Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 through AWS Bedrock
